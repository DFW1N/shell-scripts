# Active Directory Federated Services on-prem Architecture

This terraform deployment mimics a on-prem backend architecture required to run a ADFS server using a jumpbox in it's own DMZ to pivot to other machines for security purposes. This deployment will be automatically built on Azure with the correct IP Structure and Subnets.
